# Protein Planner

The Protein Planner is a meal planning app which is designed to target users who want to maximise their daily protein intake. The app allows users to create a meal plan for every meal for every day of the week!

The site acts as a repository for recipes whereby users can store their own recipes and also browse other users' recipes. Users can get organised for the week ahead by adding recipes to their meal planner for each meal for every day of the week.

### Design

The site has a very simple and clean design which was purposely chosen in order to keep in theme with the site's goal. i.e. invoking a sense of calm in the user and reducing stress when it comes to everyday meal planning. 

#### Imagery
There are 2 static images assigned to this site. The first is the protein planner logo situated top left of the header. The second is the protein circle image on the homepage displaying the different types of high protein foods with associated values.The rest of the imagery will be uploaded by users for their individual recipes. 

#### Fonts
The Roboto font is the main font used for the body of the website. This fonts were imported via Google Fonts. Serif is the backup font, in case for any reason the main font isn't being imported into the site correctly.

## Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/users/PatrickG0308/projects/13/views/1)

The 11 User Stories were broken down in accordance with apps being worked on during the project.There is a brief description of the required outcome with each story. The stories were moved across the kanban board as the stories were completed.


## Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

In order for the users to create recipes a custom recipe model was required. The recipe author is a foreign key to the User model given a recipe can only have one author.


The meal plan item model allows users to add recipes to a meal plan for a particular meal for a particular day. A meal plan item can only have one user and one recipe and is therefore linked to the User and Recipe models through foreign keys.

The diagram below details the database schema.

![Database Schema](docs/readme_images/database_schema.png)

## Testing

Testing and results can be found [here](/TESTING.md)

## Security Features and Defensive Design

### User Authentication

- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure that any requests to access secure pages by non-authenticated users are redirected to the login page. 
- Django's UserPassesTestMixin is used to limit access based on certain permissions i.e. to ensure users can only edit/delete recipes and comments for which they are the author. If the user doesn't pass the test they are shown an HTTP 403 Forbidden error.

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - Protein Planner is unable to handle this request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
- 404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
- 500 Server Error - Protein Planner is currently unable to handle this request
